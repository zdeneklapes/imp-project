    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    The task was to create a Snake Game for the ARM\-FITkit3 board based on
    microcontroller Kinetis K60 (with ARM Cortex\-M4 core) and 2x matrix displays
    (type: KWM\-30881AGB, decoder: 74HCT154).

    The result is a Snake game that can be played on the board.
    Snake is displayed on the matrix displays and the player can control
    the snake using the \textit{Fitkit3} built\-in buttons.
    Implemented game is a single player game, written in C language using
    KDS IDE\cite{KDSIDE}.

    %%%%% Hardware %%%%%

    \subsection{Hardware}\label{subsec:hardware}
    The provided HW for this project is \textit{Fitkit3} board and one
    board with 2x matrix displays.
    The board with two matrix displays 8x8 is connected to the
    \textit{Fitkit3} board using the connectors
        {\color{Green}{P1}} (placed on the Fitkit3 board) and connector
        {\color{Red}{P3}} (placed on the matrix display's board).

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Implementation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


    \section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
    Implementation of the game is placed in only one file: \texttt{Sources/main.c}.
    The other files were created by the KDS IDE for MCU K60.

    %%%%% Game %%%%%

    \subsection{Implementation of the game}\label{subsec:implementation-of-the-game}
    Implemantation is divided into 2 parts:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Button interrupt handling
        \item Timer interrupt handling
    \end{itemize}

    {\parindent 0pt In the projects are used these component of
    MCU K60 (\textit{K60P100M100SF2V2}):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{GPIO} (General Purpose Input/Output) \-
        Setting in/out pins for controlling LED's matrix displays.
        \item \textbf{PIT} (Periodic Interrupt Timer) \-
        Timer for controlling snake moves.
        Interrupt is generated every 0.24575 ms.
        \item \textbf{PORTx} (Port Control and Interrupts) \- \textbf{PORTA} and \textbf{PORTE}.
        PORTA is used for controlling LED matrix display a PORTB
        for controlling button interrupts.
    \end{itemize}

    The entry point of the program is the function \texttt{main()} located in
    \texttt{Source/main.c} file.
    At the beginning of the program, the function \texttt{SystemConfig()} is called
    where the clock for the \textbf{GPIO}, \textbf{PIT} and \textbf{PORTx} is enabled
    and pins for the \textbf{PORTx} are set as needed for all interrupts and display
    control.
    After initialization the structure \texttt{snake\_t} is initialized and then
    is continued to endless loop where the all incoming interrupts
    from \textbf{PIT} timer and buttons generated on \textbf{PORTE} are handled.


    %%%%% Button interrupt handling %%%%%

    \subsection{How to play}\label{subsec:functionality-of-the-game}
    The game is a single player game.

    %%%%% Button control %%%%%

    \subsubsection{Game Control}\label{subsubsec:controling}
    The game is controlled by the \textit{Fitkit3} built\-in buttons:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SW2} \- Snake speed up.
        \item \textbf{SW3} \- Snake turn right.
        \item \textbf{SW4} \- Snake speed down.
        \item \textbf{SW5} \- Snake turn left.
        \item \textbf{SW6} \- Snake reset (default speed and starting position).
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{buttons}
        \caption{Fitkit3 Buttons}\label{fig:figure2}
    \end{figure}

    The Snake starts moving to the right with normal speed
    at the beginning of the game.
    By pressing the coressponding button, you can change the direction of the snake
    and his speed.
    If you want to reset the game, press the button \textbf{SW6}, which sets
    the speed to the default value and places snake to the starting position.

    %%%%% Conclusion %%%%%


    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
    I managed to implement whole functionality of the game with some additional
    features like speed up/down and reset\ref{subsubsec:controling}.
